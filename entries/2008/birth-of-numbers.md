# From the Birth of Numbers

I have finally finished reading [Mathemathics: From the Birth of Numbers][]. I
had been reading a chapter a week since forever. It's about 1000 pages long and 
its greatest achievement is teaching you math from scratch, in the right order. 
What goes unnoticed by most reviewers tho, is how strongly it scrutinizes our
educational system, leading us to the conclusion it is brutalizing mathematical
reasoning in the minds of young people. Our educational system wants math to be
merely a skill, a way into being usefull in society.

Modern education doesn't realize how well it's succeeding in narrowing our 
chances of ever producing another Einstein. Suddenly scientific thinking isn't 
something we do casually, it is no longer part of our daily lives. It's part 
of the school. You're supposed to learn it to do well at tests. How are children
supposed to like it when there's so much pressure on being skilled at it, on
doing well at tests, on being admitted in a good college? You're not, you're
supposed to loathe it and avoid it.

And the problem with school isn't merely pedagogical, it is a sociopolitical
disease that has grown since the 19th century, as a counterbalance to protect
the state from an ever increasing advanced society. To quote John Taylor Gatto
in his [The Six-Lesson Schoolteacher][] essay:

The state doesn't want educated people. All it wants is useful people. As we 
fight our leaders, we totally overlook one of the very foundations of our 
broken system: education. 

I hope the internet will eventually produce an acceptable distance learning 
solution that offers a path to true education, especially if it's coupled with 
local, presential efforts.

What's currently in place is unfortunately very far from it.
