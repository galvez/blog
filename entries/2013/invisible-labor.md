# Embrace Invisible Labor

I've been walking around the room for about an hour now. Every few minutes, I
typed a few notes in the computer, which was sitting in a stand up desk. With
my thoughts still fresh in memory, I finally picked the computer up, sat down
with it and started putting together the pieces of this article.

You need to move. Sitting at the computer all the time ruins your health, 
makes you tired and vulnerable to the endless distractions the computer
display has to offer. It makes it  harder to resist all the addictive or
time wasting actvities you may engage in (but don't want to). Whereas if you
take the time to stand up and walk around, you'll find it easier to regain
focus on what you need to get done.

This line of work requires focus, creativity and inspiration. You do need to
be absorbed in thought. But you don't need to instantly write down every
little thought or try every little idea in code, or even worse, turn it into
an item in a task list. Know to take the time to shape things up completely in
the confinements of your mind, imagine the whole thing through, and only once
you've got a clear view of the big picture, allow yourself to stop, structure
your notes and put everything together.

This has been working remarkably well for me, unsurprisingly for writing, but
also for programming. I no longer mindlessly dive into coding attempts or
investigations. If I'm debugging something, I take my time to think things
through walking around the room before browsing source code. If I'm creating
a new application, I always take my time to just think about code structure,
data modelling and user interfaces before a single line of code is written.

This is perhaps an alternate version of the [80-20 rule][] for engineering and
other creative work: **spend 80% of the time thinking and only 20% of the time
actually typing things in**.
