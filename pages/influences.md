# Influencess

This website's design was heavily inspired by the work of [Nikita Prokopov][].
You should check out [his take on redesigning GitHub][].

[Paul Graham][] is quite possibly my biggest professional influence. In fact, he
influenced an entire generation of young technologists and entrepreneurs, and 
the effecs of his influence have been shown to be [long-lasting][]. [Beating 
the Averages][], [Being Popular][], [Why Nerds are Unpopular][], [The 
Hundred-Year Language][] and [How to Make Wealth][] are my favorite pieces.

[Claus Wahlers][] is an [old school][] Flash and ActionScript hacker (currently
[kicking ass on React-land][]). He is the author of [DENG][], a crazy Flash 
browser implementation that implemented various W3C standards before they landed 
anywhere else. He also wrote [FC64][], a Commodore 64 emulator for Flash Player 9.
Back in the day these were prime examples 
of ActionScript mastery. He mentored me in my early years as a programmer and 
unwillingly taught me most of my English over instant messaging.

[Mark Pilgrim][] blogged about technology and everything else for about 10 years
before [he vanished][] from the internet. He wrote [Dive Into Accessibility][],
[Dive Into Python][], [Dive Into Python 3][] and most recently, [HTML5: Up & 
Running][]. He also wrote the Universal Feed Parser, which I believe is the 
[most complete, fault-tolerant RSS and Atom parser][] out there. He was one of 
the main [advocates][] of the [Atom format][] during its development.

[Maciej Ceglowski][] makes [great web software][], writes [intriguing][] 
[essays][] and contributes to [real change][]. To paraphrase his own words, he 
lives everywhere he can. He seems to live a truly mobile life which results in
the [most][] [interesting][] [little][] [stories][]. His articles on [vector 
space search engines][] and [bloom filters][] introduced me to code that 
inspired me to study, investigate and write good software.

[Joe Gregorio][] is the co-author of the [Atom Publishing Protocol
specification][] and a blogger advocating [good software development 
practices][]. He has also authored the [URI templates specification][] and the 
Python libraries [httplib2][] and [mimeparse][]. Lately it seems Joe also has
[left Python][] work to [focus on modern JavaScript][].

[Simon Willison][] has been for a [long time][] one of my main references in 
Python programming. He has a good eye for exciting emergent technology, having
told us to [stop everything we were doing to go learn Node.js][] a year before 
it started getting so [massively popular][].

[Mark Nottingham][] is a [one-man standards body][]. In fact, it was his blog 
that introduced me to the IETF in the first place. It was after reading his 
[Caching Tutorial][] that I bothered to learn HTTP and dive into others
underlying protocols of the web. He is also the co-author of the [Atom format 
specification][]. His [website][] and [writings][] influenced my sense of 
simplicity a great deal.

[Tim Bray][] is one of the co-editors of the [XML specification][]. His blog 
covers the [recent history of modern web software development][] and has some
articles you [just][] [can't][] [miss][].

[Ryan Tomayko][] is the founder of [lesscode.org][], a blog which advocated 
smarter and leaner enterprise applications through the use of open source 
software and scripting languages. The archives are [filled with goodies][]. Ryan
also worked at GitHub for a long time.

[Hugh MacLeod][] has been amusing and educating me for a long time with his 
[cartoons][] and [guerrilla business advice][]. He's still [blogging][] and
[tweeting][] like crazy. One of my essential daily reads.

[Paul Ford][] is my brand of obsessive. He listened to all of the songs from 
SXSW 2008 and published [a review for every and each one of them][]. He came up
with [200 ingeniously hilarious ways][] to say "I Love You". He [makes a 
difference][]. He freely ponders about [cleaning his room][] and [anything 
else][] [that][] [comes][] [to][] [mind][].

[Michael Barrish][] is quite possibly my favorite writer. [Pervert][], 
[Inscription][] and [Letter][] are must reads. I remember when I first read 
them several years ago, I think it was the very first time I stopped to think 
about how good content can and does come out of the web. [All of his 
stories][] would make a classic book.
